# CartPole-DQN
This project implements a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to solve the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI's Gym. The DQN utilizes experience replay and a target network to improve training stability and performance. The agent learns to balance a pole on a cart through reinforcement learning, with visualizations to monitor its progress over multiple episodes.
